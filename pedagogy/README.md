#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository
###### Assessment Method: Formative

<u> <b>Description: </b> of how you are going to implement the above Instructional Strategy in your Simulator: </u>
<br>
 Instructional Strategy is Expository because student in this lab follow the predefined method or step to compute the result and compare result with predefined result.
