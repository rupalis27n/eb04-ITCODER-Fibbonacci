## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: Write a program of fibonacci series.

### 1. Story Outline:
Fibonacci series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers in the series.

### 2. Story:
In this simulator program the user provides the input and it will generate its fibonacci series.

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
The simulator is divided into three parts.
First part consists of an input field and three buttons(start, next, reset).
Second part has the step execution.
Thrid part is the output block.
First the user will input the number for which he wants the series to be printed then the user clicks on the next button and he will be able to see which line of code is getting executed at that point and will understand the concept of recursion.
If the user wants he can reset the simulator at any point.

#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
The user will be able to understand the concept of recursion and will be able to apply the recursion concept.

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

Describe the pathway activites here : (Guide : Set the pathway activities in line with the learning objectives (LOs)  & with a view to achieve the goals set in round #0 & round#1.  (once he begins, how he will traverse through the entire experiment ? in descriptive))

##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

Describe the challenges Here : (guide : Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/variations in questions according to User’s level, so as to invoke the learners’ interest.  (while traversing, what challenges he will face? how he has to solve and overcome ? descriptive).)

##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:
Describe the pitfalls here: (guide : (while traversing or while solving challenge, how will we bring a situation in front of him that he commits mistake if he is not attentive , or not following procedure , descriptive))

##### 2.6 Conclusion:
Describe conclusion here : (guide: This may include displaying: how much time did the user take to solve the questions/ How many questions were right?/ How many hints did the learner use. Based on this the evaluation/marking to be suggested to the user. (once he is towards the completion of the experiment, what LO he is taking along with him, what will be his probable, interpretation/conclusion , descriptive) )

##### 2.7 Equations/formulas: NA
Type equations here : (guide : ( a separate sheet having equations / programs for the lab exper3ment to be shared along with the Story submissions (1) . You can mark it as numerical reference numbers within the story narration (like we cite in the research papers) and then separately share these equations/programs sheets as a reference, do not include the equations as a whole in the narration))
Tool can be used to integrate formula in Markdown <b> [here](http://latex.codecogs.com/eqneditor/samples/example3.php) </b>


### 3. Flowchart 4
<img src="flowchart/flowchart.png"/><br>
link to flow chart Here : Store in the  /flowchart folder within Round2 folder in your repo
<br>
(guide :The lab proposer should extract logic from the story, prepare a flowchart from the story narration and write the algorithm to execute the black box.  use Google Drawings https://docs.google.com/drawings/ (send the link to your flowchart and also attach .png by exporting it )

### 4. Mindmap:
<img src="mindmap/mindmap.png"/>
 Link to mindmap here : Store the mindmap in both .mm & .png extension in the  /mindmap folder and include link of only .pdf verison here
 <br>
 (guide : An elaborate mind map (connecting all the points in the experiment flow ) should be prepared and submitted by the lab proposer. The mind map should be a clear and detailed document that takes into account all minute intri5acies involved in the development of virtual lab. The mindmap should be self-content and any developer across the globe should be able to code it with all those details. using only FreeMind http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page (send the .png file and also the original .mm extension project file. )

### 5. Storyboard :
Storyboard: <a href="Storyboard/carwiper.gif"> [here]</a>
Link to storybaord (.gif file ) here :
(guide: This document should include sketching and description scene wise (duration, action, description). Software to be used for storyboarding : https://wonderunit.com/storyboarder/ (Its a FOSS tool) . tutorial on how to use it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAeCEpG0KX4
